# m√¥si

A tiny game engine that lets you make tiny game worlds. Inspired by [Bitsy](https://github.com/le-doux/bitsy).

## Stretch goals
- Undo/redo
- Additional scripts
- Multiple sketches (like a notebook!)
- Sounds/music (ugh WebAudio)
- Screenshots/gifs/header images
- Random palette/room/world generation
- Keyboard shortcuts
